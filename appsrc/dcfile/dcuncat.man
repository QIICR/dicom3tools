.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcuncat
reads the named dicom multi frame input file, and splits it into a concatenation
of smaller instances, which will be written to files in the specified output path with the
InstanceNumber or InConcatenationNumber appended.
.LP
The concatenation instances will be placed in a new series generated from the old
series number plus 7000, unless specified otherwise.
.SH OPTIONS
The verbose output goes to standard error.
.LP
The basic input switches are described in dcintro(1). Options specific to this program are:
.TP
.B \-v|verbose
.RS
List sort order and which file contributes to which frame as it is written.
.RE
.TP
.B \-framesper n
.RS
Required. Specifies the number of frames per concatenation instance.
.RE
.TP
.B \-unenhance
.RS
Convert enhanced IODs to old unenhanced by removing per-frame and shared functional group sequences and moving their contents to the top level dataset. Implies framesper of 1.
Also adds NumberOfFrames based on SOP Class. May be specified even if source not enhanced, to avoid (empty) functional group sequences being added.
.RE
.TP
.B \-noprivateseq
.RS
When unenhancing, do not examine private functional group sequences. If not specified, default is to copy all attributes (standard or private) from within private functional group sequences,
which in the case of some vendors who hide "fallback" unenhanced object attributes in private functional groups may give better results.
.RE
.TP
.B \-noprivateattr
.RS
When unenhancing, do not copy private attributes from within functional groups (private or standard). Does not suppress examination of private functional groups. Note that
the use of \-removeprivate may also be required, if any existing top level private attributes are to be removed as well.
.RE
.TP
.B \-sameseries
.RS
Do not create a new series but rather add to the existing series.
.RE
.TP
.B \-instancenumber
.RS
Replace InstanceNumber with an incrementing value starting with 1.
.RE
.TP
.B \-instancenumberstart n
.RS
Replace InstanceNumber with an incrementing value starting with n (do not need to specify \-instancenumber); will be reflected in the output filename as well.
.RE
.TP
.B \-frameincrementpointerinstancenumber
.RS
Replace FrameIncrementPointer with a value pointing to InstanceNumber, removing any related vectors.
.RE
.TP
.B \-vectorupdate
.RS
If FrameIncrementPointer is present in source and output is one frame per instance, extract single frame-specific vector value for all
vectors referenced by FrameIncrementPointer and replace those vectors.
.RE
.TP
.B \-noconcat
.RS
Do not insert concatenation related attributes (always removes old ones whether this option is specified or not).

.SH BUGS
.LP
The unehance option is supported for copying of CT and MR attributes only at this time.
.LP
Only MR objects are currently "cleaned up" to populate missing or incomplete required attributes at this time.
