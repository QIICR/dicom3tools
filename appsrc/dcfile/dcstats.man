.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcstats
reads the named dicom or acr-nema input file and describes the statistics
of the image pixel data. The primary intent is to determine if the pixel
representation is unsigned or signed (regardless of what other attributes
may specify).
.LP
The description and verbose output go to standard error.
.PP
The basic input switches are described in dcintro(1). Options specific to this program are:
.TP
.B \-v|verbose
.RS
Display byte offset from file start and message start, in hexadecimal, and dump contents while reading and once read.
.RE
.TP
.B \-filename
.RS
Show the name of the file supplied in the arguments; a hyphen will be reported if no filename was supplied.
.RE
.TP
.B \-filename
.RS
Show the name of the file supplied in the arguments; a hyphen will be reported if no filename was supplied.
