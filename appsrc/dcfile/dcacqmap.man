.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcacqmap
reads a list of DICOM filenames from a file, and creates an HTML page containing
icon images (and optionally reports) that visualize the pattern of acquisition in terms of dimensions
of space and time and other potential dimensions.
.LP
Position is derived from Image Position (Patient) and sorted along the normal to
the Image Orientation (Patient). It is assumed (but not checked) that all the images
have the same orientation (unless separated by using -byorientation) and the same Frame of Reference UID.
.LP
After partitioning by position, the Acqusition Time (or Number or Scan Options), Convolution Kernel and Slice Thickness
are then used to distinguish images acquired at the same spatial position.
.LP
An index.html will be created in the result folder, which will also contain sub-folders for
iconic representations of the DICOM image files and reports. Within the html page each image
icon may be hyperlinked to either a dump of the DICOM contents for the first file for each
position or the difference between dumps for subsequent files.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-byacqnumber
.RS
Use the Acquisition Number rather than the Acquisition Time to separate blocks of slices acquired
at the same time; may be useful when every slice has its own different acquisition time.
.RE
.TP
.B \-byslicelocation
.RS
Use the Slice Location for position and sorting, rather than deriving distance along the normal
to Image Orientation (Patient) from Image Position (Patient).
.RE
.TP
.B \-byscanoption
.RS
Use the Scan Option value rather than the Acquisition Time to separate blocks of slices acquired
at the same time; may be useful when cardiac % RR interval is encoded in this attribute.
.RE
.TP
.B \-byorientation
.RS
Use the ImageOrientation (Patient) rather than the Acquisition Time to separate blocks of slices; may be useful if
there are different angulation in the same series.
.RE
.TP
.B \-locationtolerance n
.RS
Since calculated or specified positions may differ only by a small distance, even though they
are perhaps intended to be at the saem location, allow a fudge factor by specify rounding to
the nearest whole millimeter (1), tenth (10), hundredth (100), etc.
.RE
.TP
.B \-iconsize n
.RS
Specify a different size for icons from the default 128x128 pixels.
.RE
.TP
.B \-nodump
.RS
Supress the default inclusion of dump or diff files hyperlinked from icons.
.RE
.TP
.B \-xhtml
.RS
Create XHTML rather than HTML output.
.RE
.TP
.B \-nostyle
.RS
Do not use a CSS stylesheet, but embed style information in the HTML output, either in an HTML or XHTML form depending on whether the -xhtml flag is set.
.RE
.TP
.B \-isonames
.RS
Use short names without special characters for all files created, e.g., for recording on ISO 9660 Level 1 compliant media.

.SH BUGS
.LP
Currently only single-frame CT images have been tested. A different set of sub-keys below position would
be needed for other modalities.
.LP
When Acquisition Time is encoded by the vendor as a single value for all slices in an
acquisition step, then the strategy adopted for display works well to group steps into
columns; however, then each slice has a different acquisition time, a (very) large
number of columns may result, with the slices staggered diagonally as one would
expect. It is not clear where to look other than Acquisition Time for a single value
that spans slices in a step in such cases.
.LP
The script is intolerant of spaces in file name paths.
