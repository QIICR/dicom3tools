.SH NAME
dcmvhier.datedesc \- ACR/NEMA DICOM PS3 ... DICOM PS3 - Move DICOM files into hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 10
.B dcmvhier.datedesc filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcmvhier.datedesc
reads the named dicom or acr-nema input file and moves it into a directory
hierarchy of the form "PatientName [PatientID]/StudyDate StudyTime [StudyID - StudyDescription]/Series SeriesNumber [Modality - Series Description]/SOPInstanceUID.dcm", rooted at
the current working directory. Any characters
in the identifiers other than numbers, letters, underscore, hyphen and period
are deleted before creating the path name. The files are moved, not copied,
and renamed. If any of the necessary identifiers is missing the script aborts.
If the directory hierarchy does not yet exist it is created, but if the image
file name already exists in that directory, the script aborts (to avoid
overwriting images not properly disamibiguated by the selected identifiers
and characters).
