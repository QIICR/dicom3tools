.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcdtchg
reads all the named dicom input files (and/or the files listed in the specified
file) and copies them to the specified directory, changing all the dates and times
in a consistent manner throughout the set of files.
.LP
The dates and times obtained by two separate invocations of this utility on different files will be different, so
the action needs to be performed on a set of files simultaneously in order
to maintain consistency across studies, series and temporal frames of reference.
.LP
Normalization of dates and times involves shifting the first date and time pair encountered in the first file to a
base date, and then maintaining a consistent offset from that base date and time for all subsequent dates and times
encountered.
.LP
Normalization of the times is only performed for DT attributes and for those TM attributes
that have a known DA corresponding attribute. For example Study Date and Study Time are
treated as a pair. Any TM attribute that does not have a corresponding known standard DA
attribute will be left alone, unless it happens to have exactly the same value as another
TM attribute that does have a matching date and has been normalized.
.LP
After date and time normalization, the day of the month and the month of the year may be forced
to a value of 1 with the appropiate options, though this will potentially invalidate
time intervals that span 24 hour boundaries
.LP
All timezone information is removed and set to UTC, and the TimezoneOffsetFromUTC attribute
added, unless suppressed with the keepzone option.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
The verbose output goes to standard error.
.LP
The basic switches are described in dcintro(1). Options specific to this program are:
.TP
.B \-outdir dirname
.RS
The directory, which must already exist, to which the copied files are written, using
the basename of the original filename.
.RE
.TP
.B \-v|verbose
.RS
Display attributes as they are read and written.
.RE
.TP
.B \-l
.RS
List filenames as they are read and written.
.RE
.TP
.B \-f|filelist filename
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-basedate yyyymmdd[hhmmss]
.RS
Use a different date (and time) to which to normalize all dates and times rather than the default 20010101000000.
.RE
.TP
.B \-delta ms
.RS
Use a specific delta (such as reported on a previous run of dcdtchg), so as to shift the datetimes of another
set of instances by the same delta and hence maintain their relative temporal relationship.
.RE
.TP
.B \-forcefirstday
.RS
Replace the day of the month with 01 after shifting the date to the base date. This will potentially
invalidate time intervals that span 24 hour boundaries.
.RE
.TP
.B \-forcefirstmonth
.RS
Replace the month of the year with 01 after shifting the date to the base date. This will potentially
invalidate time intervals that span 24 hour boundaries.
.RE
.RE
.B \-keepzone
.RS
Do not change the timezone. Any TimezoneOffsetFromUTC is left unchanged. Any timezone component of
a DT attribute is copied to the output.

.SH BUGS
.LP
There is a fixed length of buffer used for reading each line from the list of filenames file.
.LP
Time normalization based on combined date and time values introduces the risk that times
may wrap around the 24 hour period (in either direction) though any corresponding date
attribute will be appropriately incremented or decremented. That is, the interval between
times will be preserved, except when the date day or month values are forced to 1. This
risk is mitigated by looking for the Study Date and Time (usually the earliest) first.
.LP
Timezone replacement does not take into account the possibility of two attributes with the
different explicit timezones in DT attributes (or different from the value in the
TimezoneOffsetFromUTC attribute) being present ... all timezone information is simply
removed and replaced with "+0000" (UTC).
.LP
Times and datetimes with a fractional second component are always output to a precision of 3 digits (milliseconds)
even if greater or lesser precision was present in the input. If a fractional component is present
but has a value of 0, then the fractional component will not be present in the output; this is
normally the case when the times in the input are specified to second precision.
