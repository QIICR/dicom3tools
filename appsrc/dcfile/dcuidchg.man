.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcuidchg
reads all the named dicom input files (and/or the files listed in the specified
file) and copies them to the specified directory, changing all the instance-related UIDs
in a consistent manner throughout the set of files.
.LP
Fixed UIDs such as SOP Classes and Transfer Syntaxes are not affected.
.LP
The UIDs obtained by two separate invocations of this utility will be different, so
the action needs to be performed on a set of files simultaneously in order
to maintain consistency across studies, series, frames of reference and
in explicit references to other instances.
.LP
Note that the basename of the original file is used for the output file, and is
not changed, so if the basename was derived from the SOP Instance UID, as is common
practice, then that name would need to be changed subsequently if the UID replacement
was being performed to prevent identity leakage.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
The verbose output goes to standard error.
.LP
The basic switches are described in dcintro(1). Options specific to this program are:
.TP
.B \-outdir dirname
.RS
The directory, which must already exist, to which the copied files are written, using
the basename of the original filename.
.RE
.TP
.B \-v|verbose
.RS
Display attributes as they are read and written.
.RE
.TP
.B \-l
.RS
List filenames as they are read and written.
.RE
.TP
.B \-f|filelist filename
.RS
A file containing a list of DICOM input files (one filename per line).
.RE
.TP
.B \-descriptor
.RS
Add (or extend) DeidentificationMethod attribute with description of UID removal.
.RE
.TP
.B \-map filename
.RS
A file to which is written the map of original to replacement UID values.
