.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dcckovly
reads the named dicom and looks for evidence of overlays, curves or graphic annotation sequences (which,
though non-standard in images, some vendors add as standard extended sop classes, as well as
some known private annotation elements
checking the high bits above Bits Stored for non-zero values (since these might be remnants
of overlays), and checking the Overlay Data for non-zero or only zero bits.
The output consists of a dump of related attributes if present, a specific message if
non-zero high bits, and a specific message if non-zero overlay data bits are found,
and a warning if the file is encapuslated.
